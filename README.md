# Full-Stack Inspiration Board: Back-end Layer

## Goal
Our goal is to create a digital inspiration board.

Users should be able to create one or more boards.

Then, a user can select a single board. When a user selects a board, they can see all the cards associated with that board.

Users can even "+1" the cards that they agree with!

### Demo

[An example implementation of the project is deployed on Render](https://ada-inspiration-board.onrender.com/). This demonstrates only one way that a project could look.

(This app may take a long time to load, so you may need to refresh it periodically.)
